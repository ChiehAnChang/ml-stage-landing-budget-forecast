## Introduction
As technology improves, people no longer want to be limited to living on Earth. Some people dream of traveling to Mars to build cities and live there, while others seek faster travel methods beyond airplanes. Many well-known tech companies are now entering the spaceship and rocket industry. One of the most famous is SpaceX, known for its lower rocket-launching costs. According to research from IBM's Data Science Project, SpaceX spends about 62 million dollars per rocket launch, compared to 165 million dollars spent by other companies. This significant cost difference is because SpaceX uses a technique that allows reusing parts of rockets, commonly known as first-stage boosters. Ensuring the successful reuse of these boosters is crucial, and this can be analyzed and predicted through machine learning techniques.

The main objective of this project is to use machine learning models to predict successful rocket landings, ultimately helping space companies improve their rocket reuse strategies. Reducing the cost of launches and increasing booster reusability contributes significantly to making space travel affordable.

In this project, Section 2 describes the cleaned dataset used for analysis. Section 3 discusses the methodology used to build machine learning models for predictions. Section 4 presents the results obtained from the machine learning analysis. Section 5 explains how the results can be reproduced, including detailed steps for data cleaning and hyperparameter tuning. Section 6 highlights potential future improvements or expansions of this research. Sections 7 and 8 include references and acknowledgments, respectively. Finally, Section 9 provides contact information.
