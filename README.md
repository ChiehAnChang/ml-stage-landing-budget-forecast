# Data-Science Forecasting Project
## A Machine Learning Approach to SpaceX Stage Landing Budget Reduction
### Acknowledgments
This project was originally generated by the IBM **Data Science Capstone** team.  
Instructors, contributors, and staff who made it possible include:

Joseph Santarcangelo, Yan Luo, Rav Ahuja, Lakshmi Holla, Azim Hirjani, Grace Barker,  
Rachael Jones, Kathleen Bergner, Bella West, Simer Preet, Lauren Hall, Hunter Bay,  
Tanya Singh, Om Singh, Malika Singla, Duvvana Mrutyunjaya Naidu, and Anita Verma.

I have modified the original project so that it can be used to simulate the day-to-day work of a data scientist.
